# Microstrip_patch_antenna
A rectangular microstrip patch antenna was designed and simulated in HFSS. The antenna dimensions were calculated based on substrate properties and resonant frequency. Key performance outputs such as S11, VSWR, gain, and radiation patterns were analyzed to evaluate antenna efficiency and operation.
